   * This class will calculate the ambient light color emitted by the sky.
   *
   * As in the real world, the color of the ambient light changes depending on the
   * daytime in the original game. To archive this effect, the game uses a list of
   * so called `SkyState`s, which describe the look of the sky at a single fixed point
   * in time. During the day/night cycle, the game then interpolates between two of
   * those `SkyState`s, the one closest *before* the current time, and the closest
   * next one. The interpolated color is then applied as ambient lighting and fog
   * color.
   *
   * Fog will also be calculated by this class, since it's parameters are embedded
   * inside the `SkyState`s as well.
   *
   * Since sky rendering is a pretty complex topic in the original game, this class
   * contains a lot of magic numbers of which we are not quite sure why many of them
   * were chosen. Probably only because it looked good.
