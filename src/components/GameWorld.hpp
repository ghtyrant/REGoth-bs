  /**
   * Component to be attached to the scene root which manages the game world.
   *
   * This is the place where ZEN-files are imported, Characters placed into the
   * world and where the worlds script engine is at home.
   *
   *
   * Loading and Saving Worlds
   * =========================
   *
   * When a world shall be loaded, the GameWorld component needs to be created
   * and attached to a Scene Object, which we call *Root SO*. By manually adding
   * the GameWorld component via `addComponent()`, you can specify the name of a
   * original ZEN-file. This ZEN-file will be parsed and imported into the
   * scene, where all created scene objects will be a (direct or indirect) child
   * of the *Root SO*.
   *
   * Once a world is imported it will function as a clean starting point. When
   * running the game, at that point you would want do run the script init
   * routine, but you don't have to. What happens after the import is done can
   * be controlled by overriding the `onImportedZEN()` method.
   *
   * At any time after the world has been created, it can be saved to a file,
   * similar to a save-game in the original game. This save game will store the
   * complete state of the world, including script state.
   *
   * Example to create an empty world:
   *
   *    HGameWorld gameWorld = GameWorld::createEmpty();
   *
   *
   * Example to import a ZEN:
   *
   *    HGameWorld gameWorld = GameWorld::importZEN("OLDWORLD.ZEN");
   *
   *
   * Example to save a World:
   *
   *    gameWorld->save("MySavegame");
   *
   *
   * Example to load a saved World:
   *
   *    bs::HPrefab prefab = GameWorld::load("MySavegame");
   *    prefab->instantiate();
   *
   *
   * World Script Engine
   * ===================
   *
   * In Gothic there is only one Script-VM which can be fed a generic program
   * file once instantiated. In REGoth, we have one more layer of abstraction
   * around it: For each kind of program file, there has to be a matching
   * interfacing script VM. For example, the script program used for most
   * gameplay related actions is called `GOTHIC.DAT`. This one needs completely
   * different externals and interface-functions than the one for the menus.
   * Therefore, the GameWorld component also instantiates the correct Script VM
   * for executing world related script code, see `ScriptVMForGameWorld`.
   *
   *
   * Script Externals
   * ================
   *
   * This component is also the place where world related script externals are
   * implemented, such as `WLD_CreateNPC()`. They might be named differently to
   * make them fit more with the other naming conventions, but you'll quickly
   * find out what is what. The externals themselves are to be implemented
   * without too many dependencies to the script VM, so it's better to use real
   * scene object or component handles as parameters rather than script objects.
   * This improves reusability of those script externals.
